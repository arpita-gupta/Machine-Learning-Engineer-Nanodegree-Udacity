Project Description:

The project focuses on classifying the breed of a dog with the help of VGG model from Pytorch, a customized CNN and Resnet with the help of Transfer learning.
The problem statement is to solve the recognition of dog breed from images provided to it.It should recognize whether the object present in an image is a dog or a human.
It should also identify the type of dog(breed)
It should also detect human if present and detect the breed of dog that human resembles to.
The solution aims to do this by means of following ways as provided to us in the provided jupyter Notebook:
1. Do the classification with the help of pretrained model(VG Net)
2. Do it with the help of a CNN (defined layers).
3. Do it by means of transfer learning on Resnet.

Libraries and Dependencies required:
 The libraries required for the project include 
Python 
Pytorch
Numpy
Torchvision
OpenCV

These dependencies can be installed with the help of conda and the commands for installing such dependencies can be referred from the following link:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html


Project Workflow:

The project is divided into various subparts :
Here we can first import datasets, libraries etc. Then I installed pytorch and all the dependencies required After that I loaded the pre trainedmodel, made my CNN and finally used transfer learning and then tested the model for different test cases using image of dogs and humans .



1. Import all the datasets.
2.Install pytorch and dependencies on the notebook instance.
3. Download the pretrained models. VG Net
4. Test the model.
5. Define a new CNN.
6. Define all the layers.
7. Do the training.
8. Test the model.
9. Do transfer learning on the model.
10. Test the model.
11. Print Human if human is detected
12. Print dog breed  after classification
13. Print invalid image if the provided image is invalid

 
Environment Used:

I used AWS Sagemaker notebook instance for training the model
and Installed all the dependencies with the help of respective commands.
